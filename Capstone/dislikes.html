                <h2>Being Left Alone &#128549;</h2>
                <p>The thing Milo hates the most is being left alone without his humans. He'd spend the day crying and waiting by the door. He'd also exhaust himself by barking and jumping trying to get us to turn back. We've truly spoiled him a little too much but it's much too late now!</p>

                <h2>Trips to the Vet &#128137;</h2>
                <p>Whether it's for grooming or a harmless checkup, Milo absolutely hates going to the Vet! He'd start shaking the moment we go inside the door. He's been going to the vet since he was a little pup but he just can't seem to get used to it. Might be because he got sick at one point and was confined so now he's permanently scared.</p>

                <h2>Meals &#129387;</h2>
                <p>Milo hates eating. He's such a picky eater and even when he's served homecooked meals, there's no guarantee that he'd eat it. We have to spoonfeed him to get him to eat. Sometimes I wonder if this dog is broken or something.</p>

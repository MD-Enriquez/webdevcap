                <h2>Milo Main Page &#128054;</h2>
                <p> My dog's name is <strong><code>Milo</code></strong> and he is a 2 year-old shih tzu and bichon mix. This is a website that's dedicated to my stupid idiot <strong>Dog</strong>.
                <p>You are currently in the main page but there will be 2 more pages other than this talking about <strong>Milo</strong>. The first will go over his likes while the second one will go over his dislikes. Honestly, I just couldn't quite find a topic to talk about so feel free to skim over and just check the execution of my website!</p>
                <p>Here he is sleeping below &#128164; Careful not to wake him up!</p>

                <h2>Milo's Early Life &#9203;</h2>
                <p>We got Milo early into the pandemic, and he was quite a bargain - He only cost us the equivalent of 0.40 US Dollars! Because he is a pandemic dog, he suffers from a lot of separation anxiety. He simply cannot be left alone by himself otherwise he'd panic.</p>
                <p>Milo can be described as a <em>Velcro Dog</em> meaning he always follows me around wherever I go, even to the bathroom! He's spoiled rotten. Unfortunately, I would have to leave him in the province soon as I go to the capital city to work &#128546;. It will be a huge adjustment for him by I'm doing this all for him!</p>
                <p>Below is a picture of him on his first Barkday! &#127874;&#127874;&#127874;</p>

                <h2>Future &#128302;</h2>
                <p>All I can hope for is for him to live a <code>long and healthy</code> Life. Life expectancy for this breed can reach over 15 years; however, Milo is quite a sickly dog! He easily gets sick and has been confined in the vet before. Please pray for him.</p>
                <p>What a Handsome boi!</p>

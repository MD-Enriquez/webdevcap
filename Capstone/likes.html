                <h2>Long Walks &#129454;</h2>
                <p>The first thing Milo likes is a nice looooooong walk. We make sure he gets plently of exercise everyday, and he usually gets 3 walks a day. He knows when it's time for a walk and he's not afraid to demand it from you!</p>
                <p>During our walks, he'd run everywhere and <code>pee on everything</code>. My mom has trouble walking him because of how active he is so I usually do it. During our walks in the park, a lot of people would call his attention and try to pet him. What I love about Milo is how <strong>friendly</strong> he is. This dog wouldn't hurt a fly! He also let's everyone, especially children touch him. I'd like to think that he makes that person's day when he allows himself to be pet.</p>

                <h2>Carrots &#129365;</h2>
                <p>We make sure to give Milo carrots everyday because he loves them so much! Not as much as regular treats of course but this one's really good for him. I cut a few pieces and put some on his bed every night so he'd have something to snack on while we sleep.</p>

                <h2>Car Rides &#128659;</h2>
                <p>Milo loves car rides like your typical dog! Every time he hears the engine turn on, He'd come running to the door begging to come. We open the window for him and he sticks his head out while we drive</p>
